Sleep Detector by Harshi Gupta

Hi, this sleep detector is one of my first major projects and as a beginner it was really fun to make it. It was so fun and thrilling that I am somehow sad that the program ends today (29th May 2022) and I will have to say goodbye to my project (not really, there will forever be changes to be implemented to make it better and better.) 

I started on the project having absolutely nothing to very little knowledge about python and at the end- I can say that I have gained a lot of exposure and knowledge and I would keep using everything I learnt here for my other projects as well.

Moving forward, 
The Sleep Detector works on facial detection system and it detects the person's facial features to conclude whether they are sleeping or not. If found sleeping, the detector rings an alarm to wake them up!
The backened of the Detector is done completely in python. I have used opencv for facial recognition and pygame to include the alarm sound. Other than that, to link the python script to our main website, Streamlit has been used which- unfortunately due to differences between the server and the client's camera couldn't be fully deployed and hence requires the user to run the sleep.py script once. 

HOW TO DO SO?

You can simply run sleep.py and then it will give you a command somewhat like 'Streamlit run {location of sleep.py}' which you can copy paste on your terminal and the py script will run on Streamlit!

Or, 

You can also just simply run 'Streamlit run {location of sleep.py}' on your terminal and it run just fine. Rest all can be done using the website I made- which was something I enjoyed the most.

After countless hours of scrolling through youtube, google and books - The SLEEP DETECTOR has been made. I would like to include that I did this whole project by myself and I am happy for the exposure the engage program provided me. Thank you, and I hope you like the project! :)

Regards,
Harshi.
